    WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP
</div>

<div class="text">
    Climate Change has gotten to a point in which it has quickly began killing our planet all because of us, humanity. 
    <br>Heres how we are the reasons for quickly killing our planet:

    <br><br> <b>The Increasing Carbon Dioxide In Our Atmosphere </b>  
    <br><img src="https://globalclimate.ucr.edu/images/evidence_CO2.jpg"  alt="Carbon Dioxide Graph">
    <br>In the short amount of time when modern society living began we rose the amount of carbon dioxide far above all of recorded history.  
    <br>Driving Cars, Air Travel, powering our homes, and even the way we farm all contributed to the greenhouse gases that plague our atmosphere now.

    <br><br> <b>Sea Levels Rising Rapidly</b>  
    <br><br><img src="https://climate.nasa.gov/system/charts/12_12_sl-chart-11-2020.jpg" alt="Sea level graph">
    <br><br>
    <br>Sea Levels are currently rising rapidly due to the melting ice sheets and glaciers that as of 2021 the rate at which sea levels rise is
    <br><strong>3.4 millimeters per year</strong>

    <br><br> <b>The Arctic Is Melting</b>  
    <br><br><img src= "https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Global-Ice-Loss-Datastream-Article.jpg" width = 800 alt="Sea Ice Graph">
    <br><br>The global temperatures becoming water has begun to melt our glaciers and the worlds ice. This melting has decreased the overall size of Earths arctic. This has disrupted ecosystems and forcing certain animals like polar bears into extinction.
